## Something about me:
#
#### Hello, my name is Iosif, I'm from Belgium and this is my final project for cs50 course.
#### Me with my wife we own a bakery so I was thinking that its a good ideea to show our products in a website , with some ads we could have more costumers.
#
## Explaning the project:
#

 #### In this website I put our products,if somebody whant to send a message or to make a order,they can send us a massage directly form the page.
 #### I put a adrees and a timetable,I think that ist all details that a costumers needs. I hope that in the future I can improve the website and the costumers could buy directly from page. At start of the page I put some photos with our products,if its a costumer who whant to see our procuct ,he can see the photos on the front page,if he it's intrested to see all our products with the price,I put a page with all our products and the price. If the costumer is intrested to see more info ,I put a page with About us,there is a adress and a timetable with the hours when the store it's open. I made also a page for register,if our costumers whants to stay in touch with as,they cand make a account,when they log in they have another page with purpose to send us a feedback or just to order something directly,they can see their message in the profil page,they can also to change ther password or ther name. I made for me and my wife ,when whe log in ,whe have a page with all the massages which was send from our costumers,we can ride their feedback,whe stock their phone number,email,adress into a databases.
